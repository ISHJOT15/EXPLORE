#### Data structures & algorithms:<br/>
We will be covering many topics in DS such as - 
Types of Data structures - Linear and non linear types.
Stack, queues, linked list, graphs, trees etc.
Algorithms - Sorting, searching, tree traversal etc.
We will be implementing these data structures in C.
Pre-requisite for this lesson is good understanding of pointers in C.
