#### Data structures & algorithms<br/>
We will be covering many topics in DS such as - <br/><br/>
Types of Data structures - Linear and non linear types.<br/>
Stack, queues, linked list, graphs, trees etc.<br/>
Algorithms - Sorting, searching, tree traversal etc.<br/>
We will be implementing these data structures in C.<br/>
Pre-requisite for this lesson is good understanding of pointers in C.<br/>
